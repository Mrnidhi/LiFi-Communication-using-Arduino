### Theory of Li-Fi Technology 
- LiFi (Light Fidelity) is a wireless communication technology that uses visible light communication (VLC) to transmit data. VLC is a type of optical wireless communication (OWC) that uses light as the medium for transmitting data. LiFi works by rapidly switching the on/off state of an LED light source. This creates a series of light pulses that can be used to encode data. A photodetector on the receiving end of the transmission can then detect these light pulses and decode the data.
